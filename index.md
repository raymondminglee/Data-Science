# Exploratory Data Analysis 

## PrEP in NYC
PrEp is a once-a-day pill that could prevent one's from HIV. As PrEP getting more and more popularity in NYC and its affordability with NYC's community healthcare provider, I thought it would be nice to do a little exploratory data analysis with its data.

## AI Pioneer
This project is a collaboration between art and engineering major students. We as a group seeks to use machine learning as a tool to make art pieces. For our group, we decided to make a spin-off version of the Cooper Pioneer, as a way to address some of Cooper Union's event with a satirical tone.  

For the model, we incorporate code from encore.ai, while updating the code with the latest Tensorflow API. The model is an LSTM model that could generate song lyrics. We trained the model with previous Cooper Pioneer issues, the school's financial statement, curriculum and so on.
